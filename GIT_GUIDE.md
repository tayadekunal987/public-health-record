# How to Update Your Repository

Since you have already pushed to GitHub before, you just need to save your new changes.

## 1. Open Terminal
Open your terminal or command prompt in the project folder.

## 2. Check Status (Optional)
See which files have changed:
```bash
git status
```

## 3. Add Changes
Stage all your modified files:
```bash
git add .
```

## 4. Commit Changes
Save the changes with a message describing what you did:
```bash
git commit -m "Fixed admin flickering, added dashboard buttons, and updated doctor dashboard"
```

## 5. Push to GitHub
Upload the changes to your repository:
```bash
git push
```

---
**Done!** Your changes are now on GitHub.
